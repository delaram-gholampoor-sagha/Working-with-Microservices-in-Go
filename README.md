# Working-with-Microservices-in-Go
I'll develop a number of small, self-contained, loosely coupled microservices that will communicate with one another and a simple front-end application with a REST API, with RPC, over gRPC, and by sending and consuming messages using AMQP, the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.We'll also learn how to deploy our distributed application to a Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
